## Generating the base Dataset

1. `users.json` was generated by scraping geekgroup.app
2. `new_to_me.rb` was forked to be used as library functions
3. `users.json` was parsed and flat mapped through `download_ratings`
4. `dataset.json` was created

Records from `dataset.json` were filtered to create a filtered dataset (e.g. games with at least 10 ratings).
Filtered dataset was used to fit a recommender via `Disco::Recommender#fit`. Various values of `factors` were tested
ranging from 1 to 1000.

Unique items were extracted and batch fetched (`download_things`) to get additional metadata for output enrichment (`item_id_to_name.json`).

## Enriching output

Output of recommended items is only an `item_id`. `item_id_to_name.json` stores a map to translate those into game names. This map was generated
via batched calls to `download_things` (up to 150 item_ids per call seemed fine)
